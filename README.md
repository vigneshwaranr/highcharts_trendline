# Highcharts Trendline

Please use the original repository [virtualstaticvoid/highcharts_trendline](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/highcharts_trendline) if you need trendline support for highcharts.

This fork is a trimmed version of that repository by removing support for exponential regression and bringing the linear regression code down to a single function.
