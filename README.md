# Highcharts Trendline

Please use the original repository [virtualstaticvoid/highcharts_trendline](https://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/highcharts_trendline) if you need trendline support for highcharts.

This fork is just to minimize the code by removing things that I don't need (like exponential regression).
